    <h1>Elizabeth II</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Elizabeth II</b> (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926)[a] is
      Queen of the United Kingdom and 14 other Commonwealth realms.[b][c]
    </p>

    <p>
      Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and
      Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth). Her father
      acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother, King
      Edward VIII, making Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated
      privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second
      World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947,
      she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and
      their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in April 2021. They had
      four children together: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal;
      Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.

    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was born at 02:40 (GMT) on 21 April 1926, during the reign of
      her paternal grandfather, King George V. Her father, the Duke of York
      (later King George VI), was the second son of the King. Her mother, the
      Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother), was the youngest
      daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore
      and Kinghorne, at whose London home (17 Bruton Street, Mayfair) she was
      delivered by Caesarean section.[2] She was baptised by the Anglican
      Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, in the private chapel of Buckingham
      Palace on 29 May,[3][d] and named Elizabeth after her mother; Alexandra
      after her paternal great-grandmother, who had died six months earlier; and
      Mary after her paternal grandmother.[5] Called "Lilibet" by her close
      family,[6] based on what she called herself at first,[7] she was cherished
      by her grandfather, George V, whom she affectionately called "Grandpa
      England",[8] and her regular visits during his serious illness in 1929
      were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising
      his spirits and aiding his recovery.[9]
