    <h1>Elizabeth II</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Elizabeth II</b> (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926)[a] is
      Queen of the United Kingdom and 14 other Commonwealth realms.[b][c]
    </p>

    <p>
      Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and
      Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth). Her father
      acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother, King
      Edward VIII, making Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated
      privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second
      World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947,
      she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and
      their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in April 2021. They had
      four children together: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal;
      Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.

    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was born at 02:40 (GMT) on 21 April 1926, during the reign of
      her paternal grandfather, King George V.<br />
      Her father, the Duke of York (later King George VI), was the second son of
      the King. Her mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen
      Mother), was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude
      Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, at whose London home
      (17 Bruton Street, Mayfair) she was delivered by Caesarean section.
      <sup><a href="Hello!">[2]</a></sup>
      She was baptised by the Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, in
      the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May,[3][d] and named
      Elizabeth after her mother; Alexandra after her paternal
      great-grandmother, who had died six months earlier; and Mary after her
      paternal grandmother.[5] Called "Lilibet" by her close family,[6] based on
      what she called herself at first,[7] she was cherished by her grandfather,
      George V, whom she affectionately called "Grandpa England",[8] and her
      regular visits during his serious illness in 1929 were credited in the
      popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding
      his recovery.[9]
